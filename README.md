# 🌐 Personal Portfolio — Rohit

This is my personal developer portfolio built using **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
It showcases my projects, skills, experience, and contact information in a clean and modern interface.

The goal of this website is to present who I am, what I build, and what I am currently learning — in a simple, elegant, and high-quality design.
